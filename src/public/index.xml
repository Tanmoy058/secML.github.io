      <title>Starting Seminar</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first seminar meeting will be Friday, January 26 (not this Friday, which would normally be the first class day, since I will be getting back from California too late to meet this week). Meetings will be Fridays in Rice 032, 9:30am-noon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re missing the normal first meeting, I want to do as much of the organizational stuff this week to be able to have a substantive first meeting next week. This means we will group students into teams, have a team assigned to lead the first class, and announced topic and readings by next Tuesday (Jan 23).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable this, everyone interested in participating in the class in any way should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submit this form by Wednesday (Jan 24): &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/FqSmUNHYBPbaKsg72&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/forms/FqSmUNHYBPbaKsg72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the pcourse syllabus](/syllabus/), and follow the directions there to join the seminar slack group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will work out the teams based on the form submissions, and set up the schedule for leading classes/blogging. I will have office hours on Monday (Jan 22) at 2:30pm. People from the first presenting team will be expect to meet with me then (not necessarily everyone but at least some of the team), and anyone with questions about the seminar is also welcome to come by. (If this time works for the class, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep this as my regular office hours time for the semester.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for missing the first class, but I think we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to manage most of what we would have done the first day electronically, and be able to have an effective first meeting on Jan 26.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This graduate-level special topics course will be offered in Spring
2018. Meetings will be &lt;strong&gt;Fridays, 9:30-noon&lt;/strong&gt; in Rice Hall 032. More
information will be posted here soon, but the seminar format will be
roughly similar to what we used to &lt;a
href=&#34;https://tlseminar.github.io&#34;&gt;TLSeminar&lt;/a&gt; last Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seminar will focus on understanding the risks adversaries pose to
machine learning systems, and how to design more robust machine
learning systems to mitigate those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar is open to ambitious undergraduate students (with
instructor permission), and to graduate students interested in
research in adversarial machine learning, privacy-preserving machine
learning, fairness and transparency in machine learning, and other
related topics.  Previous background in machine learning and security
is beneficial, but not required so long as you are willing and able to
learn some foundational materials on your own.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For more
information, contact &lt;A href=&#34;https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans&#34;&gt;David
Evans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cs6501-security-and-privacy-of-machine-learning&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cs6501: Security and Privacy of Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University of Virginia, Spring 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings:&lt;/strong&gt; Fridays, 9:30AM - noon, Rice Hall 032&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Objective.&lt;/strong&gt; This seminar will focus on understanding the
  risks adversaries pose to machine learning systems, and how to
  design more robust machine learning systems to mitigate those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Previous background in machine learning and
security is beneficial, but not required so long as you are willing
and able to learn some foundational materials on your own. Most
students in the seminar should have either strong background in
machine learning, or strong background in security and privacy, but it
is not expected that most students have extensive background in both
areas. The seminar is open to ambitious undergraduate students (with
instructor permission), and to graduate students interested in
research in adversarial machine learning, privacy-preserving machine
learning, fairness and transparency in machine learning, and other
related topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinator:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans&#34;&gt;David Evans&lt;/a&gt;
  (evans@virginia.edu). My
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/office&#34;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; is Rice 507.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-expectations&#34;&gt;Course Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students in the seminar are expected to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead discussions on interesting topics during the class meetings.
For each week, there will be a team of students charged with
preparing a topic and leading the discussion, and another team
charged with writing a blog post about the class. Students
responsible for posting the blog summary will be different from the
ones charged with leading the topic discussion, but should work
closely with the leaders on the posted write-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particpate actively in class meetings.  This means being prepared to
contribute by doing the assigned preparation (which will typically
involve reading a few research papers, but may involve other things
also) and thinking about the materials deeply to be able to
contribute well to discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contribute fully to a team that develops a course-long project which
could either be a research project or a systematization of knowledge
project. We will discuss this more in an early class, and form teams
based on interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;communications&#34;&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Website:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://secml.github.io/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  All
  course materials will be posted on the course website, and students
  will be expected to provide materials to add to this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://secprivml.slack.com&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://secprivml.slack.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  We
  will use a slack group for class communications.  You can join using
  any &lt;code&gt;@virginia.edu&lt;/code&gt; email address.  You can also create slack
  channels for your team communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;honor-and-responsibility&#34;&gt;Honor and Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe strongly in the value of a &lt;em&gt;community of trust&lt;/em&gt;, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.  The course will be better for everyone if
everyone can assume everyone else is trustworthy. The course staff
starts with the assumption that all students at the university deserve
to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this course, we will be learning about and exploring some
vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise deployed systems.
&lt;strong&gt;You are trusted to behave responsibility and ethically.&lt;/strong&gt; You may
not attack any system without permission of its owners, and may not
use anything you learn in this class for evil.  If you have any doubts
about whether or not something you want to do is ethical and legal,
you should check with the course instructor before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;area-requirements&#34;&gt;Area Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note for CS Graduate Students.&lt;/strong&gt; This course is mislisted in SIS
(indeed, it is a &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; in the setup of SIS that cannot be overcome
that requires all grad courses to be assigned areas) as counting for
the &amp;ldquo;Software Systems&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Theory&amp;rdquo; area requirements.  As per the
actual rules in the Graduate Handbook, a cs6501 seminar course does
not a priori count for any particular areas.  It may be possible to
count it for any area, but it would be up to you to make the case to
your committee that it should count for a given area. In most cases,
this will depend a lot on what you individually do in the class - for
example, you could select presentation topics and a topic for you
project that would make a strong case for counting it for the &amp;ldquo;Theory&amp;rdquo;
area, but someone else who does a systems-focused project would be
able to count it for a different area. I can help provide guidance on
this, but it is ultimately up to your committee to decide if a course
counts for a particular area requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;responsibilities&#34;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each week (except for project proposal and presentation weeks),
one team will be responsible for Leading the class, one team for
writing a Blog post on the class topic, and one team for arranging
food.  See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/schedule&#34;&gt;Schedule&lt;/a&gt; for team responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading Team.&lt;/strong&gt;  The team responsible for leading a class should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks before the scheduled class, meet briefly with me (Dave) to
discuss plan for the class. You should decide on a team leader for
this class, who will be the one responsible for making sure everyone
on the team knows what they are doing and coordinating the team&amp;rsquo;s
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday the week of the class, at least a few representatives
from the team should come to my office hours to discuss the plan for
the class.  You should come prepared to this meeting with suggested
papers and ideas about how to present them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No later than the Monday before class, send out to the class Slack group the preparation materials for the class.  This can include links to papers to read, but could also include exercises to do or software to install and experiment with, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day of class: lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating class! This is a 2.5 hour class, so it can&amp;rsquo;t just be a series of unconnected, dull presentations. You need to think of things to do in class to make it more worthwhile and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After class: help the Blogging team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions, and reviewing their write-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging Team.&lt;/strong&gt; The team responsible for blogging a class should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week before the scheduled class, develop a team plan for how to
manage the blogging. One team member should be designated the team
leader for the blogging, and post on slack so we know who is
responsible. The blogging leader is responsible for making sure the
team is well coordinated and everyone knows what they are doing and
follows through on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During class, participate actively in the class, and take detailed
notes (this can be distributed among the team).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the Tuesday following class, have a draft of the blog post ready,
and share it with the rest of the class (including the leading team
and coordinators) for comments. Details on how to prepare the blog post are on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/blogging&#34;&gt;Blogging Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the next Friday (one week after the class), have a final version
of the blog post ready to add to the course site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeding Team.&lt;/strong&gt; The team responsible for food should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan among yourselves what food to bring and who is responsible.  If
you want to use my credit card to buy food, borrow it. You can stop
by Thursday afternoon to pick it up from me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring something yummy and something with caffiene, but not too messy
or disruptive, to class. A simple choice is to get a coffee
container and bagels from the bagel shop in Rice Hall (but make sure
to get the order in early enough to be ready before class). More
adventurous choices are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to clean up the room at the end of class. If we get caught
leaving a mess, we probably will not be allowed to have food
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the receipts to get reimbursed, and take care of the
reimbursement. This is easiest if you just borrow my credit card and
then all you need to do is send me an image of the receipt (or hand
me a physical receipt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://secml.github.io/blogging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions for how to create the class blog posts for
your assigned classes.  I believe each team has at least a few members
with enough experience using git and web contruction tools that
following these instructions won&amp;rsquo;t be a big burden, but if you have
other ways you want to build your blog page for a topic let me know
and we can discuss alternative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.  Hugo is a static website
generator that builds a site from Markdown pages.  (With homebrew on
Mac OS X, this is easy: &lt;code&gt;brew update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew install hugo&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone the github repository,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/secML/secML.github.io&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://github.com/secML/secML.github.io&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This is what is used to build the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/&#34;&gt;https://secml.github.io/&lt;/a&gt; site.  If you are
working with multiple teammates on the blog post (which you probably
should be), you can add write permissions for everyone to the cloned
repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should create your page in the &lt;code&gt;web/content/post/&lt;/code&gt;
subdirectory. You can start by copying an earlier file in that
directory (e.g., &lt;code&gt;class1.md&lt;/code&gt;) and updating the header section
(between the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; marks) and replacing everything after that with
your content.  Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to &lt;strong&gt;update the date&lt;/strong&gt; so your page will
appear in the right order. You can put &lt;code&gt;draft = true&lt;/code&gt; in the header,
so your page will not appear on the course website until it is
ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use multiple files (but probably only one in
the &lt;code&gt;post/&lt;/code&gt; directory (this will show up as pages on the front
list).  Use the &lt;code&gt;web/content/images&lt;/code&gt; directory for images and the
&lt;code&gt;web/content/docs&lt;/code&gt; directory for papers.  Using images and other
resources to make your post interesting and visually compelling is
highly encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write the blog page using Markdown.  Markdown is a simple markup
language that can be used to easily generate both HTML and other
output document formats.  You can probably figure out everything you
need by looking at previous posts, but for a summary of Markdown,
see &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&#34;&gt;Markdown: Syntax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the post, run &lt;code&gt;make develop&lt;/code&gt; (in the &lt;code&gt;web/&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory of
your repository).  This starts the Hugo development server, usually
on port 1313 (unless that port is already in use).  Then, you can
view the site with a browser at &lt;code&gt;localhost:1313&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are ready, submit a pull request to incorporate your
changes into the main repository (and public course website).  Also,
send a message to me (dave) on slack, so I know the post is ready to
review.  At this stage, I will probably make some requests for
improvements, and then will post the edited version to the course
site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
