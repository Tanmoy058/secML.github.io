## Machine Learning Background
<!-- - Other ML algorithms use linear decision boundaries (SVM, LR, ...)
- Deep learning uses linear units with nonlinear composition
	- More susceptible to attacks
- Define terms like gradient and loss -->

In Machine Learning, we train our model with training data along with the label associated with it. For training purposes, we extract the features and based on that we deploy an algorithm to train the whole model. For classifying the testing data, classifier uses decision boundary to separate points of the data belonging to each class. In a statistical-classification problem with two classes, a decision boundary partitions all the underlying vector space into two separate classes. It will classify all the points on one side of the decision boundary keeping the rest points on the other side of the boundary. Like this way it will separate all the points into two different classes. SVM-support vector machine is a linear classifier which construct a boundary by focusing two closest points from different classes and it finds the line that is equidistant to these two points.

#### Loss functions
Loss functions defines that how good our model is at making predictions for a given scenario. It has its own curve and its own gradients. The slope of the curve indicates the appropriate way of updating the parameters to make the model more accurate in case of prediction. A frequently used loss function is the 0-1 loss function.

where I is the indicator notation. Hinge loss function is also popular in machine learning field. It provides a relatively tight, convex upper bound on the 0-1 indicator function.

#### Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm which is used to minimize cost function by iteratively moving the direction of the steepest descent. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters (coefficients in Linear Regression and weight in neural networks) of our model.

In the figure, weight is slowly decreasing from the initial stage. J(min) is the minimum value of the cost function which can be obtained by optimizing the algorithm. 

Recently, there have been quite a good number of successful applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in the fields of information retrieval, computer vision, and speech recognition. Despite their potential, deep neural architectures, like all other machine learning approaches, are vulnerable to what is known as adversarial samples. This indicates that these systems can be fooled with the help of non-obvious and potentially dangerous manipulations. An adversary can infer the model underlying an application and thus examine the importance of features/classes of the data. This will help them to identify the features which are more important on correct classification. An adversary can, with minimal effort, craft an adversarial sample with the feature importance knowledge. This synthetic example generated by slightly modifying a real example in order to trick the model into “believing” that this modified sample belongs to an incorrect class with high confidence. To defend against these adversarial attacks, many researchers are exploring several directions including data augmentation, increasing model complexity etc. Their main goal is to protect the model against the manipulation of the attackers.

## Applications and Vulnerabilities
	
To get a better idea of what security and privacy mean in a machine learning context, we highlight a few
applications and examine the possible consequences of vulnerabilities in these domains.

One of the most commonly discussed applications is in self-driving cars, which use machine learning algorithms for image recognition tasks, such as identifying traffic signs and road hazards.  If an attacker were to cause an erroneous classification, e.g. mistaking a stop sign for a speed limit sign or missing a pedestrian in a crosswalk, both property and human lives would be in jeopardy. (Although luckily self-driving cars use a variety of other techniques to avoid collisions like GPS and radar.)  

Machine learning has also found a place in the medical world, being used to identify patterns and trends in patient histories that can be used for diagnoses, to recognize abnormalities in medical imaging, and even to evaluate the efficiency of a hospital's workflow.  In healthcare, the risks are two-fold - there are both safety and privacy risks that need to be considered.  An attacker could manipulate the models used for diagnostics and pattern recognition, thereby putting patient health at risk, and there is also the potential for confidential patient data to be leaked either through the training process or the final model itself. 

There are numerous other uses of ML today (targeted advertising, fraud detection, malware detection, etc.) and each carries with it unique security and privacy concerns.

## Adversarial Fundamentals

In machine learning, an adversarial example is an input to the trained model that has been manipulated so that the model returns a different, incorrect output.  A classic adversarial example for image classification is from a paper by Goodfellow et. al., which features a photo of a panda that was originally classified correctly, but is misclassified when carefully-crafted noise is added.  The model classifies the new image as a gibbon, even though human eyes can easily see it is a panda.

### Classifying Attacks

Attacks can be categorized by many different characteristics, but are often referred to in terms of the attack method, the goal of the attack, and the adversary's level of knowledge.

#### Attack Method

A poisoning attack is when the adversary adds carefully-crafted samples into the training data, thereby disrupting the learning process and manipulating the final trained model.  An evasion attack occurs when a sample originally correctly classified into class A is manipulated and fed back into the model, now receiving an output that is *not* class A.  A key difference between these two attacks is where each occurs in the ML pipeline, with poisoning occuring before the training stage and evasion attacks occuring after training, during the testing stage.

#### Goal of Attack

The adversary's goal is another way to describe attacks, which in this case means whether or not there was a specific goal classification or not.  Error-generic (also called untargeted) attacks aim to misclassify a given sample, but do not have a specifically targeted class. Conversely, error-specific (targeted) attacks deliberately change the sample's classification from the original class A to a chosen class B. 

#### Adversary Knowledge

The level of knowledge the adversary possesses generally falls into one of three loosely defined categories: black box, grey box, and white box attacks.  Black box attacks assume the lowest level of adversary knowledge, generally only allowing the final classification to be known without any finer details about the model.  On the other end of the spectrum, white box attacks assume that the attacker knows everything about the model, including the specific algorithm used, the feature set, the training data, etc. An attack by an adversary who knows more about the model than a black box but less than a white box is called a grey box attack, although the exact definition tends to vary.
