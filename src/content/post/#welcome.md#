This graduate-level special topics course will be offered in Spring
2018. Meetings will be **Fridays, 9:30-noon** in Rice Hall 032. More
information will be posted here soon, but the seminar format will be
roughly similar to what we used to <a
href="https://tlseminar.github.io">TLSeminar</a> last Spring.

This seminar will focus on understanding the risks adversaries pose to
machine learning systems, and how to design more robust machine
learning systems to mitigate those risks.

The seminar is open to ambitious undergraduate students (with
instructor permission), and to graduate students interested in
research in adversarial machine learning, privacy-preserving machine
learning, fairness and transparency in machine learning, and other
related topics.  Previous background in machine learning and security
is beneficial, but not required so long as you are willing and able to
learn some foundational materials on your own.  </p> <p> For more
