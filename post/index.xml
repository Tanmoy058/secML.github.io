      <title>First Week</title>
      <link>https://secml.github.io/first-week/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This message was also sent out by email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since not everyone has joined the slack yet, I&amp;rsquo;m sending this out by
email, but please make sure to join
&lt;a href=&#34;https://secprivml.slack.com&#34;&gt;https://secprivml.slack.com&lt;/a&gt; soon. I
will use that for future communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grouped the 18 full participants in the class into three teams of six:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Bus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anant Kharkar&lt;br /&gt;
Ashley Gao&lt;br /&gt;
Atallah Hezbor&lt;br /&gt;
Joshua Holtzman&lt;br /&gt;
Mainuddin Ahmad Jonas&lt;br /&gt;
Weilin Xu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Gibbon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aditi Narvekar&lt;br /&gt;
Austin Chen&lt;br /&gt;
Ethan Lowman&lt;br /&gt;
Guy &amp;ldquo;Jack&amp;rdquo; Verrier&lt;br /&gt;
Jialei Fu&lt;br /&gt;
Jin Ding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Panda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bargav Jayaraman&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher Geier&lt;br /&gt;
Faysal Hossain Shezan&lt;br /&gt;
Nathaniel Grevatt&lt;br /&gt;
Nishant Jha&lt;br /&gt;
Tanmoy Sen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams will probably adjust a bit over the next week as some people
who registered for the class didn&amp;rsquo;t submit a survey, and others may be
joining the class late, etc., but otherwise we will plan to keep with
these teams through spring break and possible re-arrange things after
that.  You can, of course, rename your team and develop your own
adversarial (but tasteful) team icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week, one team will be responsible for leading the class, one
team for blogging (writing a summary of the class), and one team for
food. Everyone in the class is expected to do the preparation for each
meeting, which will usually involve reading a few papers (but may
involve other activities, at the design of the leading team).  See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/teams/&#34;&gt;https://secml.github.io/teams/&lt;/a&gt; for
the description of team responsibilities.  For the first week, Team
Bus will be the leading team, Team Gibbon will be the feeding team,
and Team Panda will be the blogging team.  I have created a slack
channel for each team, and you should have an invitation to join
it. The immediate tasks for each team are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Bus: decide on a leader who will be responsible for coordinating your team for this week, come up with some ideas what you would like to do for Friday&amp;rsquo;s meeting, make sure there are some people who can come to my office hours on Monday (2:30pm) - if not enough people can come then, arrange an alternative time with me, and plan an exciting and worthwhile seminar for Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Gibbon: you are the feeding team for this week, so should select 2-3 people to take care of this. One of you should pick up a credit card from me on Thursday to pay for the food. You will be leading the seminar on 2 Feb, so should determine a leader for this, and once Team Bus posts the topic and paper for this week (which should happen on Monday), should start planning your topic. We should meet briefly after Friday&amp;rsquo;s seminar, to discuss your plans, and then a longer meeting the following Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Panda: you are the blogging team for this week, so should get familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/blogging/&#34;&gt;https://secml.github.io/blogging/&lt;/a&gt;. You will be leading the seminar or 9 Feb, so should start thinking of topics you would like to lead. You should identify leaders for blogging, feeding, and leading to be ready for the next 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dave&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting Seminar</title>
      <link>https://secml.github.io/starting-seminar/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://secml.github.io/starting-seminar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first seminar meeting will be Friday, January 26 (not this Friday, which would normally be the first class day, since I will be getting back from California too late to meet this week). Meetings will be Fridays in Rice 032, 9:30am-noon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re missing the normal first meeting, I want to do as much of the organizational stuff this week to be able to have a substantive first meeting next week. This means we will group students into teams, have a team assigned to lead the first class, and announced topic and readings by next Tuesday (Jan 23).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable this, everyone interested in participating in the class in any way should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submit this form by Wednesday (Jan 24): &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/FqSmUNHYBPbaKsg72&#34;&gt;https://goo.gl/forms/FqSmUNHYBPbaKsg72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://secml.github.io/syllabus/&#34;&gt;course syllabus&lt;/a&gt;, and follow the directions there to join the seminar slack group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will work out the teams based on the form submissions, and set up the schedule for leading classes/blogging. I will have office hours on Monday (Jan 22) at 2:30pm. People from the first presenting team will be expect to meet with me then (not necessarily everyone but at least some of the team), and anyone with questions about the seminar is also welcome to come by. (If this time works for the class, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep this as my regular office hours time for the semester.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for missing the first class, but I think we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to manage most of what we would have done the first day electronically, and be able to have an effective first meeting on Jan 26.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This graduate-level special topics course will be offered in Spring
2018. Meetings will be &lt;strong&gt;Fridays, 9:30-noon&lt;/strong&gt; in Rice Hall 032. More
information will be posted here soon, but the seminar format will be
roughly similar to what we used to &lt;a
href=&#34;https://tlseminar.github.io&#34;&gt;TLSeminar&lt;/a&gt; last Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seminar will focus on understanding the risks adversaries pose to
machine learning systems, and how to design more robust machine
learning systems to mitigate those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar is open to ambitious undergraduate students (with
instructor permission), and to graduate students interested in
research in adversarial machine learning, privacy-preserving machine
learning, fairness and transparency in machine learning, and other
related topics.  Previous background in machine learning and security
is beneficial, but not required so long as you are willing and able to
learn some foundational materials on your own.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For more
information, contact &lt;A href=&#34;https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans&#34;&gt;David
Evans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
